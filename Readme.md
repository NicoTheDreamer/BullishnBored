DERO Bullish'n'Bored System - p2p chat/rpc client on the DERO blockchain by Nico the Dreamer aka CrypticNico

This program is presented as a work in progress in as-is condition. It is my first-ever golang project and, while still incomplete, is my proof-of-concept of what a cool cli BBS on DERO could look like. Thus far I have focused on the Golang-based command-line front end implementing the DERO Graviton database structure. Left to do is writing a smart contract to host the DB on the blockchain to enable persistent memory accessible to anyone with a connection to a node. Future considerations will include fun things like multi-player games and challenges. I have implemented a rudimentary personal inbox for each user to carry on p2p conversations separate from the public message channels.

This is my offering to the DERO community, I look forward to contributing in more meaningful ways as I continue to learn and grow.

Luvs ya,
-Nico
